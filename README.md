#War_Card_Game

This was a warm up project to help practice OOP, from Udemy Course: https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/ w/ Jose Portilla.

#The Game

The game has two players that play war against each other. A special rule has been implemented that requries players to have 5 cards in order to have a "war". If they can not play cards while at "war" they lose.

The rules for the game can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)
